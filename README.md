# Timeless Emerald

The vanilla Pokémon Emerald experience, with modern time-based mechanics that replace the real-time clock.

In Timeless Emerald, the in-game time will pass so long as the game is running, including if the player is in a menu or battling. Time will not pass when the game isn't running.

This mod was developed with the Analogue Pocket in mind as there is currently no GBA core for Analogue Pocket's openFPGA which supports the real-time clock, but it is also suitable to play on all other devices or emulators, especially where the real-time clock isn't supported.

Unlike other RTC removal mods, the in-game time has been changed to pass much faster than before. Specifically, one in-game day passes in about 48 minutes of real time. This means that "daily" events will occur at a substantially faster rate than before. For instance, berries now grow so quickly that it's possible to plant a berry and harvest the resulting plant after just a few battles. Lum Berries grow in 96 minutes of play time, instead of 48 hours!

Various other time-based events have been adjusted to work better without the real-time clock:

- The Dewford Hall's trends will change more slowly in terms of in-game time, but still faster in terms of play time. This means it'll be a bit harder to get the Feebas you're looking for, but it should still be manageable.
- Post-game Poké News events (Lilycove rooftop sales, the Berry Master, Slateport Energy Guru sales, Mauville Game Corner bonus days) will remain active for 4 days (about 3 hours of play time) once the countdown has elapsed, instead of one. The "ending soon" news report will be shown on the last in-game day of any given TV news event, instead of during its final hours.
- Mass Outbreaks (i.e. "swarms") will last a full in-game week (about 5 and a half hours of play time). Mass outbreaks obtained from record mixing will last 3 in-game days (about 2 hours of play time).
- PokéNav calls will be attempted every 8 in-game hours (16 real-time minutes) instead of every 10 minutes.
- The weather cycle affecting the areas around Routes 119 and 123 now has randomness to it. Every in-game day, the weather cycle will now have a 33% chance to move forward by one step, instead of always moving forward to the next step in its cycle.

This mod is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Pokémon Emerald Version. This means that your existing save file should work seamlessly when moved over to this mod, and time should continue at the mod's accelerated rate. If you want to move from Timeless Emerald back to Pokémon Emerald Version (no hard feelings!), you'll be able to use the base game's RTC reset feature to get your clock back to real-time—just hold B+Select+Left on Pokémon Emerald Version's title screen!
